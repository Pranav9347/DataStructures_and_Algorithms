'''
- Finds shortest path from source vertex to all other vertices
- Works for weighted graphs as well as unweighted graphs

Algorithm:
Starting from source node, visit all nodes, in the order of the tentative shortest paths(greediness). This greediness(extract min) can be implemented efficiently using min heap
While visiting a node v, relax all edges (v,i) for all unvisited verices i
Relax(u,v): if new_dist=dist[u]+graph[u][v]<d[v], then update d[v] to new_dist

Computational complexity:
Space: O(n^2)
Time: O(n^2 logn)
